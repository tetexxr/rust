[Crates.io](https://crates.io/) is where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects for others to use.

# Documentation

Another neat feature of Cargo is that running the `cargo doc --open` command will build documentation provided by all your dependencies locally and open it in your browser. If you're interested in other functionality in the `rand` crate, for example, run `cargo doc --open` and click `rand` in the sidebar on the left.
